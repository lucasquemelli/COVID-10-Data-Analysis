# Project Description

This is a data analysis project in order to explore COVID-19 world data using SQL and create a dashboard using Tableau. 

The dataset used in this project contains COVID-19 world data in the period between Jan 2020 and Dec 2022. It is available on [Our World in Data - Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

# 1. Database

The steps to create a database were:

1. Firstly, we created two tables from the dataset downloaded: (1) Covid Deaths and (2) Covid Vaccinations. 
2. Then we used DBeaver as a database manager. Thus we created a connection with SQLite and a database. 
3. Finally, we imported the csv files to the SQLite database.

# 3. Data Visualization
